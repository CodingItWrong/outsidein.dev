# About This Guide

## Testing on the Frontend
The World Wide Web started out as a platform for displaying static documents, but now it hosts fully-featured interactive applications. The JavaScript language and browser APIs allow building user interfaces that are in many ways as rich as traditional desktop and mobile applications. Frontend JavaScript frameworks like React and Vue.js abstract away many of the details of managing the user interface, allowing developers to focus on the business functionality.

Back when JavaScript was only used to provide a little enhancement on top of server-rendered web pages, testing your JavaScript code was both difficult and, in many cases, unnecessary. But now many web applications have their entire user interface rendered by JavaScript, so testing your JavaScript becomes extremely important. Thankfully, JavaScript test runners, framework-specific testing libraries, and end-to-end testing tools have stepped up to fill the gap.

But like in every area of computing, on the frontend, just having good testing tools isn't enough. Many or most developers don't like their tests. Maybe the tests take much longer to write than the corresponding production code. Maybe one change to production code breaks many tests, requiring lots of effort to fix them. Maybe the tests fail sporadically for no easily understood reason. Maybe the tests don't actually seem to be testing anything that matters. Whatever the reason, the bottom line is that their tests aren't delivering on the promise to improve the development experience.

One major factor that makes testing difficult is that testing is an irreducibly complex topic. There might be only one obvious way to implement a certain production feature, but there are likely several possible ways to test it, each with pros and cons that make it difficult to know which to choose. Judgment is necessary. And usually you can't learn judgment from testing tool documentation. Judgment comes from time and experience.

But we *can* learn from others' experiences. This guide is an attempt to demonstrate how testing principles that emerged in other programming environments apply to frontend development. We'll see how to apply the practice of test-driven development—specifically, a form called outside-in test-driven development. This practice helps you write tests that thoroughly cover your app but are loosely-coupled so they don't hinder you from making changes.

## Who Is This Guide For

- **Frontend developers new to testing.** If you haven't written unit or end-to-end tests in frontend apps before, this guide will walk you through the basic elements of these types of tests. You'll get familiar with some of the best tools for writing them, as well as techniques that will help you minimize the costs of those tests while maximizing the value they provide.
- **Frontend developers new to test-driven development.** If you write your frontend tests after you write your production code, this guide will show you how and why you might want to write your tests first. You'll see how test-driven development helps you ensure you cover all the functionality of your app that you might otherwise miss, as well as keeping your tests at an interface level so they won't easily break.
- **Frontend TDDers who only write component tests, or write them first.** This is sometimes referred to as classic TDD, or middle-out TDD because you start with the inside of your app—in the case of frontend apps, your components. You'll see why end-to-end tests complement your unit tests by adding a different kind of coverage, and how they can help keep your units even more focused by helping you avoid TDDing unneeded functionality. You'll also see how Cypress overcomes some of the pain points you may have experienced with end-to-end testing tools in the past.
- **Experienced TDDers new to the frontend.** This was me when I moved into frontend development. I didn't want to leave behind the TDD practices that had helped me so much in server-side apps, but there weren't many resources on how to do TDD effectively in modern frontend frameworks. This guide will give you what you need to take the TDD techniques you love and apply them in React or Vue, as well as suggestions for what judgment calls might make sense in frontend development.

## Chapters

The chapters of this guide are grouped into three sections.

The first section, **Concepts**, is about general concepts related to outside-in TDD:

- *About This Guide* is this chapter.
- *Why Agile?* describes problems common to much of software development, and how agile development practices address those problems. These practices include small stories, evolutionary design, test-driven development, refactoring, and others.
- *Testing Concepts* introduces a number of testing terms and clarifies how they will be used in this guide.
- *Why TDD?* focuses on one particular agile development practice: test-driven development. It explains why writing tests before you write the production code has the surprising benefits of regression safety, test robustness, and speed of development.
- *Outside-In TDD* describes the approach to TDD this guide will take: outside-in TDD. It explains how end-to-end tests and unit tests work together to ensure both the external and internal quality of your app.

The second section, **Exercise**, puts outside-in TDD into practice by building a real application. There are two versions of most of the chapters in this section: one version using Vue and the other using React. The chapters are:

- *Exercise Intro* describes the exercise in general and presents the option of choosing either the Vue or React version.
- *About This Exercise* introduces the tech stack we will be using for your chosen version of the exercise.
- *Project Setup* prepares our process and codebase by listing out the stories we'll work on, getting the project spun up, configuring it, getting tests running on CI, and getting it automatically deploying to a hosting service.
- *Vertical Slice* puts outside-in TDD into practice with our first feature, for reading data from an API. We build a minimal feature that touches all layers of the app, to start getting them built out.
- *Refactoring Styles* demonstrates the benefit of thorough test coverage by allowing us to separate setting up functionality and styling. We take our plain-looking app and apply a nice look-and-feel to it,  while the passing tests assure us we haven't broken anything.
- *Edge Cases* adds some more detail to our first feature, handling loading and error states. We show how handling these edge cases at the unit test level keeps our end-to-end tests simple and fast, and how TDD helps us ensure we have all edge cases covered by test.
- *Writing Data* puts what we've learned all together by building out a second feature, this time writing data to the server. We see how to work with forms and verify data posted to the server. First we build out the core functionality in an outside-in TDD loop with end-to-end and unit tests, then we handle edge cases with additional unit tests
- *Exercise Wrap-Up* reflects back on how the outside-in TDD process went over the course of the guide, and the benefits we saw as a result.

The third section, **Next Steps**, wraps up the guide. It points to additional resources you can use to learn more about test patterns, tools, outside-in TDD, refactoring, and agile in general.

## Prerequisites

You'll have the best experience with this guide if you already have the following:

### Familiarity with React and Redux, or Vue and Vuex

The middle section of this guide will involve building a frontend application in one of two stacks: React and Redux, or Vue and Vuex. It's helpful if you already have some familiarity with the stack you choose. We won't be using any features that are too advanced, and we'll explain what's happening as we go. But we won't explain *everything* about how the frameworks work or why. Because of that, if you don't already know the stack you'll choose, it's recommended that you go through a basic tutorial on it first. The Vue and React guides are excellent, so they make a great place to start:

- Vue and Vuex
  - [Vue.js Guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/)
  - [Vuex Guide](https://vuex.vuejs.org/guide/)
- React and Redux
  - [React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
  - [Redux Tutorial](https://redux.js.org/basics/basic-tutorial)

### Familiarity with Jest or Mocha

Jest and Mocha are two popular JavaScript testing libraries. We'll be using Jest in this guide. We won't be using any features of Jest that are too advanced, so if you have a basic familiarity with one of these two tools you should be set. And Jest and Mocha are similar enough that if you've used Mocha (and its related libraries Chai and Sinon) you should be able to pick Jest up no problem. But if you haven't used either of these libraries before, it's recommended that you look through the Jest docs to get familiar.

- [Jest - Getting Started](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/getting-started): in the "Introduction" section, read "Getting Started" through "Mock Functions".

Interestingly, our end-to-end test framework, Cypress, uses Mocha under the hood. But in our Cypress tests we'll mostly be using Cypress APIs, not Mocha ones. So don't worry about getting familiar with Mocha if you haven't used it before: you'll be able to pick it up as we go.

## Text Formatting

When we are displaying whole new blocks of code, they'll be syntax highlighted like this:

```jsx
export default function App() {
  return <div>Hello, world.</div>;
}
```

If you haven't used Vue or React before, you may be surprised to see that they each have ways syntactically to combine JavaScript code and what looks like HTML tags. See the Vue or React Guides for more details.

Because we'll be using test-driven development, we'll be spending less time writing large chunks of code and more time making tiny changes to existing code. When that happens, we'll use diff syntax, where lines that are added have a `+` to the left of them, and lines that are removed have a `-`. Those lines will also be colored to draw attention to them:

```diff
+import RestaurantScreen from './components/RestaurantScreen';
+
 export default function App() {
-  return <div>Hello, world.</div>;
+  return (
+    <div>
+      <RestaurantScreen />
+    </div>
+  );
 }
```

These `+`s and `-`s aren't part of the code for you to type in; they just highlight the changes.

## About the Author

<img src="/josh.jpg" class="author" title="photo of the author, Josh Justice" />

I'm Josh Justice, and I've worked in software development for 16 years as of this writing. For the first 10 years I worked in server-rendered web applications (the only kind of web applications most of us had back then). And I wasn't doing any automated testing. Every change I made required manually retesting everything in the browser. As you might imagine, that resulted in a lot of builds sent back from QA that delayed releases, and a lot of bugs that made it to production anyway. I usually wasn't working into nights or weekends to get features shipped, but there was always the very real likelihood I'd get an evening phone call about a production issue I needed to fix urgently. I attempted to make my apps more reliable by trying different programming languages and frameworks, but the problems persisted.

Eventually I was introduced to unit testing and browser automation testing, and I saw a glimmer of hope. But the language ecosystem and companies I was working in didn't have much experience at testing, so we were all trying to figure it out together. That all changed when I moved to Ruby on Rails. In Ruby, the testing paths are well-trod. I was able to learn from experienced testers and see the kinds of tests they wrote. I saw them (and myself!) ship code to production as soon as the pull request was merged—we knew it would work because the tests passed. I saw security patches applied in a matter of minutes instead of weeks because, as long as the tests passed after we updated, we knew we could release.

Testing wasn't the only thing I learned from the Ruby community, though. With the confidence that test coverage gave us, we were freed up to make improvements to the code at any time. We focused on naming variables, methods, and classes to clearly describe what they do. We split up long complex methods into smaller ones so that the topmost function read like a summary of steps. We rearranged code so that new features fit in cleanly instead of being hacked in with deeper and deeper nested logic. All of this meant that I could jump into a codebase I had never seen before and understand it quickly. This not only made my development more productive; it also made it a lot more fun. I spent a lot less time worried and stressed, and a lot more time interested and excited. And *that* made me more productive, too.

A few years ago my focus shifted to frontend development. Because of all the benefits I'd seen from testing, one of the first things I looked for was how to do testing in frontend web applications. And the answer was effectively "we're working on it." There were still a lot of questions up in the air about how to build frontend apps that were consistent, performant, and simple, and with those things in flux it made sense that testing approaches were in flux as well. As I tried to understand the testing practices as best I could and trace them over time, I became more and more convinced that the testing principles I'd learned on the backend applied to frontend apps just as well. Most of the differences weren't due to inherent differences between the platforms but rather a lack of information flow from one programming ecosystem to another. That's what convinced me to create a number of frontend testing resources over time to share what I had learned so far.

The culmination of that process is this guide. It encompasses the practices I'm most convinced lead to applications that are reliable, maintainable, and evolvable. These are the practices I reach for on the frontend, and that I would also reach for no matter what platform, language, or framework I was using. This guide is an organized presentation of the advice I most commonly pass along to coworkers in code reviews and pairing sessions. These practices came to me having stood the test of time, and I believe they'll continue to do so.

## What's Next

With that, we're ready to get started learning about outside-in frontend development. We begin looking at the problem that agile development practices are intended to solve.
